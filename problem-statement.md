### Problem Statement Title AI-Driven Research Engine for Commercial Courts 

### Description Background: 
- Objective: To address the issue of faster resolution of commercial disputes and foster a conducive environment for ease of doing business in India. 
- Legislation: The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 was enacted to establish commercial courts for efficient dispute resolution. 
- Government Efforts: Various legislative and policy reforms have been undertaken by the Government of India, with the judiciary's support, to strengthen the commercial dispute resolution system. 
- Challenge: Expediting the resolution of commercial disputes is unlikely to succeed without addressing the broader issue of the huge pendency of cases in courts. 
- Proposed Solution: Leverage technology to expedite the dispute resolution process. Solution Requirements: 
1. Development of an AI-Driven Research Engine:    
- Exclusively designed for commercial courts to ease the legal research process for judges and judicial officers.    
- The aim is to contribute to faster dispute resolution. 
2. Roles and Functions of the Research Engine:    
- Data Aggregation and Processing: The engine must aggregate and process legal data sources, including case laws, statutory provisions, rules, etc.    
- Information Extraction: Extract relevant information, identify key legal principles, precedents, and provide results accordingly.     
3. Customization:    
- Results should be tailored to the needs and demands of each specific commercial suit. 
4. Predictive Analytics:    
- The engine must forecast case outcomes based on historical trends and patterns. 5. Data Localization:    
- Ensure that results meet the diverse requirements of different High Courts in the country.    
- Emphasize local laws, rules, and procedures. 
6. Technical Feasibility:    
- The solution must align with the technical requirements of the Indian Judicial System. 
7. Reliability:   
- Ensure that the results are relevant and reliable. 
8. User-Friendliness:    
- The Research Engine must be easy to use. 
9. Multilingual Support:    
- The engine must support multiple languages. 
10. Ethical Concerns:     
- Measures must be taken to ensure the engine operates neutrally and transparently.     
- The engine should act as a facilitator, not a decision-maker. 

### Expected Outcome: 
- Development Objective: To develop an "Artificial Intelligence-Driven Research Engine for Commercial Courts."
- Pilot Project: The solution may be considered for a pilot project aimed at reforming commercial courts. 
- Ultimate Goal: To assist in expediting legal research and streamlining judicial processes, thereby improving the ease of doing business in India.
